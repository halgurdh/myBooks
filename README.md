# Book Recommendations Web App

A simple, mobile-friendly Next.js 13+ web app that recommends books based on user search queries.

Results are paginated and sorted by average user ratings fetched from Open Library.

## Features

- Search for books by keyword or topic.
- Automatically fetches synonyms to broaden search results.
- Displays only books with cover images.
- Pagination to browse results in pages of 16 books.
- Books sorted by average rating (highest first).
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Links to detailed book pages on Open Library.
